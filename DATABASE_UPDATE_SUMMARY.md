## Database Structure

```sql
CREATE TABLE School (
    school_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    school_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    school_address VARCHAR(255),
    principal_name VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT 'Not specified',
    principal_username VARCHAR(100) DEFAULT NULL,
    status ENUM('active', 'inactive') DEFAULT 'active',
    UNIQUE (school_name)
);
```

## API Changes

### School Data Endpoints
All school-related endpoints now return the additional fields:
- `principal_name`
- `principal_username` 
- `status`

### New Operations
- School activation/deactivation
- Principal account creation
- Enhanced school editing with principal information

## UI Improvements

### Admin Dashboard
- Added Principal and Status columns to school listing
- Status badges with color coding (green for active, red for inactive)

### School Management

## Security Considerations

- Principal passwords are auto-generated with sufficient complexity
- Username uniqueness is enforced
- Status changes are logged and controlled
- All database operations use prepared statements

## Testing

After applying these updates:
1. Test school creation with principal information
2. Verify principal login functionality
3. Test school status changes
4. Confirm data integrity across all operations
5. Validate UI displays correctly

## Backup Recommendation

Before applying these changes to production:
1. Create a full database backup
2. Test the migration on a copy first
3. Verify all functionality works as expected
4. Keep the migration script for future reference
